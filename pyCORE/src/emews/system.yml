# Global configuration for the eMews system.  It is assumed that all nodes share this configuration
# file.  To override or add configuration options on a per-node level, use a node configuration file.
# For environments in which each node has its own copy of eMews, the node configuration file is not
# needed, as this file would be unique to each node.
# YAML 1.2 compliant
general:  # general eMews daemon options
  # Delay (seconds) to start services from eMews daemon invocation.
  service_start_delay: 120
  # Delay to wait for 'graceful' thread shutdown.  After this wait, continue shut down.
  thread_shutdown_wait: 5  # in seconds (-1 = disable)

communication:  # communication related eMews daemon options
  host: localhost  # host to bind to (should be localhost or 127.0.0.1, etc)
  port: 32518      # port to use

logging:  # logging configuration
  logger: emews.distributed  # send log messages to a designated node across the network
  message_level: DEBUG  # log messages of this level and above
  logger_parameters:  # parameters specific to the chosen logger
    host: 10.0.0.21  # host/IP to send log entries to (designated node)
    port: 32519  # port on destination host to send log entries to

startup_services:
  # Any services which should start immediately can be placed here.  Per node startup services
  # should be placed in the respective node config file.  # Services which do not need to be started
  # immediately should be launched using a request client, to minimize initial memory spikes.
